## Completed Deliverables

### Planning & Architecture (âœ… Complete)
- [x] Requirements analysis and clarification
- [x] System architecture design
- [x] Technology stack selection
- [x] Epic breakdown and planning
- [x] Documentation structure creation
- [x] Project timeline estimation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Begin Epic 1: Foundation Infrastructure**
   - Start with PostgreSQL schema design
   - Set up initial Docker Compose configuration
   - Create service templates

### Short Term Goals (Next 2-3 Weeks)
1. Complete Foundation Infrastructure epic
2. Establish development environment
3. Begin parallel development of data services

## Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
- **Microservices Architecture**: Hard service boundaries with REST APIs
- **Technology Stack**: Kotlin/Spring Boot for business logic, Python for data integrations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for all persistent data
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose for development and production
- **Security**: JWT tokens, environment variables for secrets

### Technical Decisions
- **LLM Provider**: OpenAI initially, with provider abstraction
- **Data Strategy**: Local-first with normalized data aggregation
- **Authentication**: Secure credential storage with encryption
- **CLI Framework**: Spring Boot CLI for rich command-line experience

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Garmin API limitations | Medium | Low | Use official python-garminconnect, respect rate limits |
| LLM API costs | Medium | Medium | Implement caching, optimize prompt usage |
| Service complexity | Medium | Low | Strong testing, clear API contracts |
| Development timeline | Low | Medium | Parallel epic development where possible |

## Resource Requirements

### Development Environment
- Docker Desktop for container development
- PostgreSQL for local database
- IDE support for Kotlin and Python
- Access to Garmin Connect and Hevy Pro accounts for testing

### External Services
- OpenAI API access (initially)
- SMTP service for email delivery
- GitHub for repository and CI/CD

## Communication Plan

### Documentation Updates
- Project status updated weekly
- Epic progress tracked in individual epic documents
- Architecture decisions documented as they're made
- README kept current with setup instructions

### Milestone Reviews
- End of each epic: Demo and retrospective
- Monthly: Overall progress review and timeline adjustment
- End of each phase: Stakeholder review and planning adjustment

## Success Criteria

### Definition of Done (per Epic)
